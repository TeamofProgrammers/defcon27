# Def con 27 - Team Of Programmers
## Traditions
Part of our tradition each year is that we each purchase an identical, cheap, burner laptop. We attempt to find the lowest cost new laptop on the market that is of the form factor of a netbook. While many people think that this is purely for security, it's for a multitude of reasons. If I'm being honest, security isn't really the objective.

* Practical Reasons
** Our team has identical configurations. Linux will often come with it's own set of issues, driver problems, setbacks, etc. By having the same hardware, and identical configurations at launch, any stumbling blocks encountered only have to be solved once, and it's then solved for everybody. 
** We don't need to waste a lot of time each wrestling to get something to work.

- The real reasons
   - I like the smell of a new laptop. I mean... seriously, new things are the shit. 

## Kali Linux
The distro shame is real, nothing turns me off from a conversation quicker than a distro shamer.  The main reason kali is chosen, is that it's comes with most everything we need out of the box, plus more tools to explore and tinker with. We have no interest in building an entire distro from source. Plus it looks cool. Next year we are going to all get kali tramp stamped while in vegas. It will be fun. 

## Windows Focus
The plan for each defcon is to develop more and more attack strategies FROM windows. This receives a lot of hate. We have our reasons. It goes back to our skillsets, and work responsibilities. The more we can take away from defcon that will directly affect our work related skillset the better. 

## Burners Through The Years
defcon 25
: Lenovo IdeaPad 110s
: 11 inch netbook. Had about 2gb ram soldered on. Can't remember the processor, but this thing was pretty garbage. For some reason this made it fun. 
: This had a really solid look and feel to it. Even though it was cheap, it FELT good and solid. In fact, mine still works to this day. I spilled dr pepper on it during a presentation, and it still works! 

defcon 26
: Lenovo IdeaPad 120s - with Kali linux
: Same model as the one used in defcon 25. Possibly upgraded processor. They changed the color from white to a dark grey. 
: Touchpad was greatly improved
